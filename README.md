# Hi, I'm Moiz

I work in cybersecurity with a focus on red and purple teaming. Most of what I do revolves around learning, building, and breaking things to understand them better. Much of that learning ends up here in the form of experiments and tools I’ve built.

- I share CTF writeups and security notes on my blog. (Currently on [Medium](https://medium.com/@rizzziom), moving soon to my website.)
